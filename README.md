📌 Notes & Tips
🛡️ VAC Status: As of April 7, 2025, all scripts are undetected by VAC.
⚠️ Overwatch can still detect you if someone spectates—use at your own risk.

🦘 Bhop Info:

Works best in:

Public/Comp/Prem Games: 1–2 consistent bhops

Private Servers (no autobhop): 2–3 consistent bhops

Bhop success rate may vary depending on server tickrate.

🔧 All keys and behaviors are fully editable in their respective .ahk or .ini files.

🧠 Reminder
These tools are meant for "*educational*" and personal use. Stay safe, and don’t be obvious.

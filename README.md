# CS2-Config-ahk-macro
A compilation of my cs2 configs and ahk macros all made by me
For the NoRecoil.ahk it needs the config.ini to work in the config.ini you can change your own settings
Movement ahk has a bhop macro and a nade macro
Trigger bot is a rancomized trigger bot based on pixel get colour
All of this *should* be undetectable by vac (As Of April 7 2025)  as i have used all of it for over 6 months, however it will *obviously* be detectable by overwatch so be careful when being spectated
Paste the movement folder + autoexec.cfg + nulls.cfg into your cs2 cfg folder for the bhop to work + lots of other customisable changes
Bhop macro doesn't always work but consistently gets 1-2 bhops in pubs/comps/prem and 2-3 in private server (no autobhop)
